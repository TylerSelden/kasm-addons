# kasm-addons
A few helpful addons for Kasm Workspaces

## Initial setup

To import all of the addons, run these commands:

```
cd /opt/kasm/bin
git clone https://github.com/TylerSelden/kasm-addons
cd kasm-addons
chmod +x ./*
```

This will create a directory called `kasm-addons` inside of `/opt/kasm/bin`, inside of which all the scripts are stored.
